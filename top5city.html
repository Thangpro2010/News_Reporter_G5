                            Seoul is located in the northwestern part of Korea, with an estimated land area of ​​605.52
                            km² with a radius of about 15 km, divided into the north and south halves by the Han River.
                            The Han River has played an important role throughout Korean history. During the Three
                            Kingdoms period in Korea, the three countries always tried to gain control of this land,
                            where the river was used as a trading post to China (across the Yellow Sea). However, this
                            river is no longer used for maritime purposes because the estuary is located on the border
                            between the two Koreas and is blocked from civilian passage. <br><br>
                            Historically, the city during the Korean dynasty was surrounded by the Seoul Fortress Wall,
                            stretching between four main mountains in central Seoul: Namsan, Naksan, Bukhansan and
                            Inwangsan. The city is surrounded by eight mountains as well as the lands of the Han River
                            Delta and the western region. Due to its geography and economic development policy, Seoul is
                            a very multi-center city. The area was originally the former capital of the Korean dynasty,
                            and mainly consists of Jongno District and Jung District, forming the historical and
                            political center of the city. However, for example, the city's financial center is
                            considered thriving in Yeouido, while its economic center is the Gangnam district.

                        <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">

                            The history of Seoul can be traced back to 18 BC, when it was the capital of Fei Cheng of
                            the Baekje Dynasty (founded in 18 BC) in northeastern Seoul. There are several city walls
                            remaining in that area from this point. Phong Load earth citadel, a earthen wall just
                            outside Seoul, is believed to have been at the main location of Captain Le Thanh. When the
                            three countries of the Three Kingdoms contested this strategic area, control shifted from
                            the Bach Te court to Cao Cau Ly in the 5th century and from Cao Cau Ly to Tan La in the 6th
                            century. <br><br>

                            In the 11th century, after defeating Reunification, the Gaoqilian court built a summer
                            palace in Seoul (present-day Seoul), called "Nanjing". Only from this period, Seoul became a
                            more densely populated area. When the Korean Dynasty (also known as Joseon) replaced Cao Cau
                            Ly, the capital was completely relocated to Hancheng, and became the capital of the Korean
                            Dynasty until the dynasty collapsed in 1910. in the 14th century, it was the royal residence
                            until 1592. Another great palace, Xuong Duc Cung, was built in 1405, serving as the royal
                            palace from 1611 to 1872. After the Dynasty Tien changed its name to the Korean Empire in
                            1897, and Hancheng was also renamed Seoul as it is today.
                            In 1945, the city was officially renamed Seoul, and was designated a special Korean city in
                            1949.

                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
                    During the Korean War, Seoul was considered the main battlefield and was repeatedly torn between the
                    military of the DPRK (also known as Korea or North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (also known as
                    South Korea or South Korea), which caused the city to be almost completely destroyed after the war.
                    The Korean capital had to temporarily relocate to Busan. An estimate of the enormous damages shows
                    that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories were destroyed.
                    In addition, an influx of refugees entered Seoul during the war, increasing the population of the
                    city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5 million in 1955. <br><br>

                    After the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As the Korean economy began
                    to develop rapidly in the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began moving to Seoul and
                    other major cities. Since the 1970s, the size of the Seoul administrative area has expanded
                    dramatically as it merged several towns and villages from several surrounding counties. The
                    aggressive economic policies of the 1960s and 1970s helped rebuild the city very quickly. Seoul is
                    the engine that creates the miraculous Han River miracle for the Korean economy.

                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
                    According to the Köppen climate classification, Seoul is predominantly a humid continental temperate
                    climate and includes only a few features of the humid subtropical climate, despite the fact that
                    Korea
                    is surrounded by all three seas. The suburbs of Seoul are usually cooler than central Seoul because
                    of
                    the urban heat island effect. Summer normally has a hot and humid climate due to the influence of
                    the
                    East Asian monsoon, with the rainy season lasting from June to September. August is the hottest
                    month of
                    the year, with an average temperature of 23.4 ° C to 32.6 ° C (74 ° F to 91 ° F) and also hotter.
                    Winters are very cold when compared to regions in the same latitude, with typically below freezing,
                    January average temperatures ranging from -5.9 ° C to 1.5 ° C (24.7 ° F to 31.4 ° F Winter is
                    usually
                    much drier than summer, although it normally takes 24.9 days to snow in a year in Seoul.
                    Temperatures
                    drop significantly below −10 ° C (14 ° F) and in some cases as low as −15 ° C (5 ° F) during the

                            Delhi, a true cosmopolitan city with diversified culture is the capital of the world’s
                            largest democracy, India. Known as Indraprastha in ancient times. <br><br>

                            The state is spread over an area of 1483 square kilometer. According to the Indian geography
                            the state is located at the center of the Indian subcontinent, amidst the ranges of Himalaya
                            and the Aravalli. Delhi has been wooed by rulers, attracted invaders and has been build and
                            destroyed several times. Historians say that is has been rebuilt seven times during
                            different ages. <br><br>

                            Situated on the banks of river Yamuna, Delhi is located at 28.38° N and 77.13° E on the
                            northern part of India. There are three major geographical regions: the Yamuna flood plain,
                            the ridge & the Gangetic Plains. The Yamuna flood plains provide fertile soil suitable for
                            agriculture. However, these plains are prone to recurrent floods. With an average altitude
                            of 293 m above sea level, the ridge forms the most dominating feature in this region.

                        <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
                            Delhi, the capital of India has a strong historical background. It was ruled by some of the
                            most powerful emperors in Indian history. <br><br>

                            The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. The town was known as
                            Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. In due course eight more cities came alive
                            adjacent to Indraprastha: Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah,
                            Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad. <br><br>

                            Delhi has been a witness to the political turmoil for over five centuries. It was ruled by
                            the Mughals in succession to Khiljis and Tughlaqs.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">In 1192 the legions of the Afghan warrior Muhammad of Ghori captured the
                    Rajput town, and the Delhi Sultanate was established (1206). The invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1398
                    put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur, who, after the
                    battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire. The early Mughal emperors favoured Agra as
                    their capital, and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah Jahan built (1638) the walls of
                    Old Delhi. <br><br>

                    From Hindu Kings to Muslim Sultans, the reins of the city kept shifting from one ruler to another.
                    The soils of the city smell of blood, sacrifices and love for the nation. The old 'Havelis' and
                    edifices from the past stand silent but their silence also speaks volumes for their owners and
                    people who lived here centuries back. <br><br>

                    In the year 1803 AD, the city came under the British rule. In 1911, British shifted their capital
                    from Calcutta to Delhi. It again became the center of all the governing activities. But, the city
                    has the reputation of over throwing the occupants of its throne. It included the British and the
                    current political parties that have had the honour of leading free India. <br><br>

                    After independence in 1947, New Delhi was officially declared as the Capital of India.</p><br>




                <h3><i>3. Weather</i></h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Delhi has an atypical climate version of the humid subtropical climate
                    (Köppen Cwa). The hot season lasts from 9 April to 8 July with average high temperatures above 36 °
                    C (97 ° F). The hottest day of the year averages May 22. The cold season lasts from December 11 to
                    February 11 with average high temperatures below 18 ° C (64 ° F). The coldest day of the year
                    averages January 4. In early March, the wind direction changed from northwest to southwest. The
                    monsoon comes in late June, accompanied by an increase in humidity. <br><br>

                    Temperatures in Delhi typically range from 5 to 40 ° C (41.0 to 104.0 ° F), with the lowest and
                    highest ever recorded temperatures being −6.7 and 47.8 ° C, respectively ( 19.9 and 118.0 ° F). The

                    (55 to 90 ° F). The highest temperature recorded in July was 45 ° C (113 ° F) in 1931. Average
                    annual rainfall is about 714 mm (28.1 in), mostly during the monsoon period in July and August. The
                    average monsoon day in Delhi is June 29.</p><br>
                <h3><i>4. Culture</i></h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Delhi is considered a multicultural city. With 26 million people, Delhi is
                    described as a miniature India, with the emergence of many different cultures, religions and
                    traditions, most notably the "open heart" land. <br><br>
                    The residents of this city have always been intimately adapted and attached to this constantly
                    changing culture. The people of Delhi give themselves an intimate name "Dilliwalas" - a term derived
                    from the phrase "Dillwalo ki Dilli", which means the land of people with open hearts. <br><br>

                    The diversity of this city makes it very easy to find your own little corner. The vibe of the
                    capital Delhi is likened to the pleasant, sweet scent of your favorite coffee shop. You can smell,
                    feel a lot of things as soon as you step in and freely choose what you like. <br><br>

                    According to Anjhula Mya Singh Bais, who has lived in New Delhi for six years described, the city is
                    the political center, but at the same time the fashion capital of the country. It gives a feeling of
                    a mix of New York City and Washington DC. <br><br>

                    However, this also makes it harder for newcomers to blend in than in other Indian cities. "Delhi is
                    a place where people will notice who you are, where you are from, what you wear or drive, so
                    newcomers need time to settle in," Anjhula Mya Singh Bais said.</p><br>

                            São Paulo is located in the southeast of Brazil and is also located in the southeastern
                            state of São Paulo, in the middle of two neighboring cities, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro.
                            The city is located on a plateau outside of Serra do Mar (Portuguese for "Sea Range" or
                            "Coastal Range"), itself part of a vast region known as the Brazilian Plateau. , with an
                            average altitude of 799 meters (2,621 ft) above sea level, although only at a distance of 70
                            km (43 miles) from the Atlantic. The distance is covered by two highways, Anchieta and
                            Rodovia dos Imigrantes, which pull downhill, leading to the port city of Santos and the

                        The city area is 1,523 km² and a population of more than 11
                        million people (2006 IBGE estimate), is the most populous city in the Southern
                        Hemisphere and is a Global City. <br><br>

                        The 19 million river people in the Greater São Paulo metropolitan
                        area (Região Metropolitana) make the metropolitan area one of the 5 most densely populated urban
                        areas in the world. If you include the nearby urban areas in the statistics such as: Baixada

                        of 40 million. <br><br>

                        The people of São Paulo are known as paulistanos. The motto of the city is Non ducor, duco,
                        which in Latin means "I am not commanded, I am the commander".</p><br>

                    <h3><i>3. Weather</i></h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
                        The city has a temperate humid climate (Cfa) that is influenced by monsoons, as classified by
                        Köppen [31]. In the summer (January to March), the average temperature is around 19 ° C (66 ° F)
                        and the average high temperature is close to 28 ° C (82 ° F). In winter, temperatures tend to
                        fluctuate between 8 and 21 ° C (46 and 70 ° F). <br><br>

                        The record high temperature was 37.8 ° C (100.0 ° F) on October 17, 2014 and the lowest of -3.2
                        ° C on June 25, 1918. The average temperature here is similar. similar to Sydney and Shanghai.
                        The Tropic of Cancer, at about 23 ° 27 'S, passes north of São Paulo and roughly marks the
                        boundary between the tropical and temperate zones of the South American continent. However, due
                        to its altitude, São Paulo is almost temperate. <br><br>

                        The city spends four seasons. Winters are cold and dry, and summers are warm with little rain.
                        Fall and spring are transitional seasons. Rain occurs infrequently in remote areas or during
                        winter around the city. Areas far from the center and metropolitan cities, can reach
                        temperatures close to 0 ° C (32 ° F), or even lower in winter.
                        Rainfall is plentiful, averaging 1,454 mm (57.2 inches) per year. It is particularly popular
                        during warm months averaging 219mm (8.6inch) and drops in winter, averaging 47 mm (1.9 inches).
                        Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast were affected by tropical storms and cyclone activity was
                        uncommon. In late winter, especially August, the city experiences a "veranico" or "verãozinho"
                        ("little summer") phenomenon, which includes hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching
                        temperatures above 28 ° C ( 82 ° F). On the other hand, relatively cool summer days are quite
                        common when nagging winds blow from the ocean. On such occasions, daily high temperatures should
                        not exceed 20 ° C (68 ° F), with low temperatures typically lower than 15 ° C (59 ° F), however,
                        in summer can be very hot when the heat wave hits the city and ambient temperature 34 ° C (93 °
                        F), but in places with a greater density of skyscrapers and less tree cover, temperatures can
                        feel like 39 ° C (102 ° F), on Avenue Paulista, for example. In the summer of 2012, São Paulo
                        was hit by a 2-week heat wave with highs between 29 and 34 ° C during the hottest days.
                        Deforestation, groundwater pollution and climate change make São Paulo increasingly vulnerable
                        to drought and water shortages.
                        Due to the high elevation of the city, there are only few "hot" nights in São Paulo even during
                        the summer months, with minimum temperatures rarely exceeding 21 ° C (70 ° F). In winter,
                        however, the strong currents of the freezer, accompanied by haze and extreme air, cause very low
                        temperatures, even in the afternoon. <br><br>

                        Afternoons with maximum temperatures between 13 and 15 ° C (55 and 59 ° F) usually occur even
                        during autumn and early spring. In winter, there have been some recent records of cold
                        afternoons, on 24 July 2013 including maximum temperatures of ° C (46 ° F) and chill winds of 0
                        ° C (32 ° F). ) in the afternoon. <br><br>

                        São Paulo is famous for its rapidly changing weather. Locals say that all four seasons can be
                        experienced in one day. In the morning, when the wind blows from the ocean, the weather can be
                        cool or even cold. When the sun reaches its peak, the weather can be very dry and hot. When the
                        sun sets, the wind gets cold again, bringing cool temperatures. This unique phenomenon usually
                        occurs in winter.

                    influenced by both
                    traditional indigenous cultures and Spanish cultures. Mexico is also the country with the
                    highest number of Hispanic people in the world, and its main religion is Roman Catholicism.
                    <br><br>
                    Mexico is the birthplace of two major American civilizations, the Maya and the Aztecs.
                    Beginning in the sixteenth century, Mexico was under Spanish colonial rule and in 1810
                    declared independence and officially recognized in 1821. Mexico is now the first Latin
                    American country to become a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                    Development (Chile became a member in 2010). Mexico is currently the 11th largest economy in
                    the world and has a high average per capita income. Mexico's economy has strong ties with
                    Canada and the US thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico is also a member
                    of many other international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Trade
                    Organization. Although considered as one of the emerging countries and an important role in
                    the Latin American region, but Mexico also faced some difficulties such as income
                    inequality, poverty and violence and drug trafficking in many regions of Mexico.</p><br>

                <h3><i>3. Weather</i></h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">It can be said that the tropical north line divides the territory of
                    Mexico into two distinct climatic zones: the temperate northern half of the tropical climate and the
                    tropical southern half, whose climatic conditions are highly dependent on altitude. . Mexico is a
                    country with many overlapping mountains and this has made Mexico one of the countries with the most
                    diverse climate systems in the world. <br><br>

                    In the southern half of the tropics, in areas with altitudes not exceeding 1000 m, there is a hot
                    and humid tropical climate all year round, with annual average temperatures ranging from 24 ° - 28 °
                    C, the difference the temperature between summer and winter is not too great, only around 5 ° C.
                    Meanwhile, areas north of the Tropic of Capricorn have lower average annual temperatures, around 20
                    ° - 24 ° C with hot, humid summers and cold and dry winters.
                    The Mexico Valley south of the Tropic of Cancer is an area that concentrates many major urban areas
                    of the country, including Mexico City. This area is located at an altitude of over 2000 m, so in
                    general, it has a relatively mild climate, with average annual temperatures ranging from 16 ° - 18 °
                    C. <br><br>

                    Much of the land in Mexico, especially north of the Tropic of Cancer, often receives very little
                    rain, creating some of the great deserts in this country. Meanwhile, in southern Mexico (especially
                    in the coastal plains like the Yucatan peninsula), the rainfall usually reaches over 2000 mm / year.

                <h3><i>4. Culture</i></h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Mexican culture reflects the complexity of Mexican history with the mix of
                    many racial and cultural complexities in the country. The two main factors that form Mexican culture
                    are the culture of the indigenous Indians and the Spanish culture, which was introduced into Mexico
                    during the 300 years of colonization. Recently, contemporary cultural influences from the United
                    States have also influenced Mexican culture. Like many other Latin American countries after
                    independence, Mexican culture gradually shaped on the basis of ethnic diversity but shared a single
                    religion, Roman Catholicism. <br><br>
                    The Porfiriato period (the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the
                    twentieth century) was marked by the strong development of Mexican culture. Under the dictator
                    Porfirio Diaz's rule, the thriving and prosperous Mexican economy accompanied the development of
                    Mexican philosophy and art. Although the country experienced a number of major events such as the
                    1910 Mexican Revolution, Mexican culture has gradually shaped the form of mestizaje, a concept of
                    cultural diversity in Mexico in which the elements are placed. Traditional indigenous as a center.
                    In 1925, in his work La Raza Cósmica, writer José Vasconcelos identified Mexico as a diverse country
                    (similar to the melting pot of the United States) not only in terms of race. but also culturally
                    [83]. This new perception has made Mexico completely different from many European countries that
                    still hold the outdated view of the superior race.
